[SEP]  i don't think that is an accurate description of the book of life in the judaic sense. the book of life is opened every year to record the righteous and to not be written in it signifies that you will die in the coming year - it doesn't grant eternal life nor afterlife at all. the concept of the book of life being linked to resurrection or afterlife was introduced by the book of daniel, and i would say is more of a cornerstone of christianity - in judaic literature it's not considered the word of god nor even prophecy. additionally, as the israelites knew that the philistines and amalekites", "reply": [101, 100, 102], "tgt": false, "convo_id": 9902125, "comment_id": 4}

{"src": " i fully agree brady has had a better and more storied career. i wouldn't even argue too much if you think brady is the goat. but given we cannot really replay their careers in a vacuum, i have to look toward 4 things : how do their teams do in their absence, what other factors have influenced their success, what are they bringing to the table, and how to others view them during their careers. when the pats didn't have brady, they won 11 games, and would have been in the playoffs in basically any other year. they also went 3 - 1 when he was suspended a few years later. alternatively, the colts went 2 - 14 when they lost manning, and the broncos improved by 5 games with him. yes, there were some other missing / different players in both cases, and the context is different, but the fact remains that the pats fared much better without brady than one would expect. second, while i don't think either qb has had across the board stellar teammates throughout their careers, we can be sure of a few things : brady had the best te to ever play, a top 3 wr, and the best coach and gm. the latter is pretty important as belichick is almost certainly one of the best coaches to ever coach in any sport. he has lost assistants in nearly every role, yet the juggernaut keeps chugging along. that coaching excellence and continuity certainly has redounded to brady's benefit. manning has had 4 coaches ranging from almost great to mediocre. marvin harrison was very good, but i think history will not remember him  marvin harrison, reggie wayne, demariyus thomas, emanuel sanders. i understand the idea of team factors in a sports setting but i think its important to note that one of these two elevated his stats during playoffs while the other did not. [SEP]  i am not trying to claim manning was playing with scrubs, but none of those guys are moss or gronk at their respective positions. also, i think the playoffs is where your coaching and preparation really showed. brady is great, but it wasn't like he suddenly got better during the playoffs ; he was often put in better positions due to better coaching a decent amount of luck. i agree that he performed, but let's not overstate the issue.
