[SEP]  well, not all of them are censored, or mosaiced. but as you wrote, you have not really seen her do these things. you have just seen ( and probably heard ) enough to know what she did. but i think that, psychologically, that makes a difference. it's a bit like, as a kid, knowing what your parents do when they're alone, but never having seen them, you can pretend they don't. ( if you've been brought up the old - fashioned way. ) but i may be wrong, just speculating. [SEP]  thinking about it, there is of course no real difference between'really'having seen something happen and having seen enough to know what happened. though i could imagine a judge in court asking the witness repeatedly and insistingly'did you actually see it happen or did you just see enough to think you know what happened? '. but that's not what i mean when i speak of innocence. it's more like, e. g. in wartime, the difference between killing someone you actually see dying, and bombing houses you know people live in. i think that, if you have a conscience, the former is a lot harder to do ( and painful to remember ).

( some marxists outside these countries refer to this arrangement as state - capitalism. ) north korea is the last remaining communist state following the pattern set by the stalinist soviet union. the implication above is that some marxists consider china and vietnam to be state capitalist because they are \" organized to a greater or lesser extent around the market \" but cuba and north korea not to be. this is incorrect, those who believe in state capitalist theory see north korea and other stalinist states as state capitalist as well as china ie the theory of state capitalism has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not a system is organized around the market. whoever wrote the paragraph above was using the term \" state capitalism \" when what i think they meant was \" market socialism \". state capitalism does not mean \" capitalist - like socialism \" it rather refers to an analysis that even a system where the state has a monopoly on the means of production and where the internal market has been abolished remains capitalist, but  alternatively, the phrase \" state capitalism \" is used correctly in this sentence elsewhere in the article : \" many have characterized the old soviet command model as state socialism or state capitalism. \" [SEP]  i see what you mean about the way the article was edited : the context was altered as the words were moved around. i don't agree with your last sentence, however. that may be a trotskyist opinion, but i'm not convinced that it is more widespread than the position \u2014 formerly official in albania and china \u2014 that the soviet union became state - capitalist in the late 1950s, a few years after stalin's death. anyway, that's not germane to the question of the phrasing of this article. i won't contest your change any further.", "reply": [101, 2048, 2364, 17859, 2967, 2907, 1996, 1000, 2110, 19640, 1000, 4106, 1012, 1996, 9253, 1011, 19817, 12868, 4801, 5130, 1997, 1996, 2248, 6102, 11765, 1006, 29464, 2216, 5105, 2011, 4116, 7656, 1007, 1998, 2037, 12446, 23416, 2015, 2360, 1996, 3354, 2586, 2150, 2110, 19640, 2104, 13125, 1998, 2008, 1996, 2717, 1997, 1996, 3354, 15984, 1010, 26141, 4385, 2020, 2110, 19640, 2013, 2037, 12149, 1011, 2070, 18448, 2015, 2040, 17678, 28819, 1996, 3399, 2052, 2360, 1996, 3354, 2586, 2001, 2110, 19640, 2104, 17497, 1006, 6244, 19817, 12868, 4801, 5130, 15454, 1996, 2110, 19640, 4106, 4498, 1007, 1012, 2070, 3424, 1011, 13921, 5130, 1013, 13125, 5130, 2907, 2008, 1996, 3354, 2586, 2150, 2110, 19640, 2104, 1047, 8093, 2271, 16179, 2004, 2106, 1996, 3354, 15984, 1006, 2129, 3475, 1005, 1056, 2242, 2027, 23613, 4863, 10047, 6806, 1007, 1012, 1999, 2151, 2553, 1010, 2119, 2967, 2052, 2655, 1996, 3354, 15984, 2110, 6178, 2146, 2077, 2151, 4066, 1997, 3006, 21470, 2001, 3107, 2029, 2003, 2026, 2391, 2004, 2000, 2339, 1996, 2126, 2009, 2001, 2109, 1999, 1996, 3720, 2001, 3308, 1012, 4312, 1010, 5580, 2017, 2156, 1996, 2391, 1045, 1005, 1049, 2667, 2000, 2191, 1012, 102], "tgt": false, "convo_id": 1920468, "comment_id": 4}

[SEP]  thanks for your comments. since the intro references afrocentrism, to my way of thinking it's certainly necessary to frame the controversy more fully at the outset. from reading the lead, it seems that the most important thing about the controversy is that some afrocentrists think it's important and that's not terribly informative. with the language i've put forward, followed by the second paragraph in the article as it now stands, i think the two would comprise a credible and comprehensive lead. article lead - ins should serve to : 1  actually, we agreed that per wiki policy the article should include every significant input on the controversy from a verifiable and reliable source, and that any attempt at restricting that scope would be pov. obviously when a point is made the contra - points ( if there are any ) should be mentioned in appropriate detail for balance, otherwise it would again be pov. if you want to add more so as to emphasise that the debate preceded afrocentrism, then go ahead and fix up the lead.

{"src": " as i have mentioned previously, i think part of fixing this article requires expanding non - controversial portions of this article to give a clearer picture of alicia machado outside of events of the last few months. for example, there is no early life section. i think editors who speak spanish could be very helpful as many sources about machado are written in spanish. i would propose adding the following on her work as an actress after the sentence about posing for playboy, based on chronology : machado was cast in the comedic soap opera'' una familia con suerte'' where she played a woman who fell in love with her brother's enemy. the show began airing in mexico in february 2011 and in the united states in october of that same year. the same source can also be used in an \" early life \" section for the facts that she is originally from maracay and is of spanish and cuban heritage.

[SEP]  this is not completely correct. this story of the plain tricolour rose after 2000 into clubs of italian far - right, as a part of a large attempt to give a form of legitimacy to the rsi. it was said that the flag of the rsi was a plain tricolour simply because a couple of laws of the rsi said so. but all rsi \" laws \" lasted no more than a pure theory. the real situation was that the rsi had been in war for all its history, and the war flag became the sole flag really used :. what would be happened if ww2 had a different ending, it's a matter of alternate history.

[SEP]  are you sure it was never used. please make sure that is accurate before you change it. from what i have read, the plain tricolour was the flag.", "reply": [101, 1996, 2880, 5210, 1997, 1054, 1012, 1055, 1012, 1045, 1012, 2001, 1996, 5810, 3059, 13012, 25778, 8162, 1998, 2498, 2842, 1996, 2120, 5210, 1997, 1996, 3059, 2591, 3072, 2001, 2081, 2880, 2011, 2093, 2270, 4490, 1024, 1077, 1000, 6335, 9530, 5332, 29480, 14866, 7163, 3367, 3089, 5292, 13433, 2072, 11703, 19565, 18178, 17488, 1015, 29662, 18740, 19908, 1052, 1012, 1058, 1012, 8840, 28093, 2080, 6394, 22823, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 3630, 3653, 8943, 6335, 2053, 4168, 13366, 5498, 29068, 2080, 4487, 1000, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 2591, 2063, 28059, 1000, 1012, 5292, 1999, 27914, 2890, 17079, 18622, 3406, 18178, 2474, 2316, 3771, 2050, 8611, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 2591, 2063, 28059, 1041, 6335, 13012, 18717, 2063, 1010, 8902, 6904, 11020, 3695, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 3630, 21396, 2721, 27377, 12418, 1005, 2004, 2696, 1012, 1012, 1012, 1000, 1090, 1006, 12064, 2063, 3972, 4921, 9530, 5332, 29480, 14866, 7163, 3367, 3089, 12418, 2080, 28093, 2080, 6394, 22823, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 3630, 3972, 2484, 13292, 6633, 13578, 3826, 9047, 16558, 5555, 3775, 2272, 1024, 2019, 10698, 5302, 1010, 12064, 2072, 3972, 9530, 5332, 29480, 14866, 7163, 3367, 3089, 8611, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 2591, 2063, 28059, 2275, 18532, 13578, 3826, 1011, 2258, 2063, 3386, 1010, 7905, 12848, 3695, 4487, 28093, 2080, 1010, 12836, 1006, 2526, 1007, 1011, 5285, 1012, 1045, 1010, 6643, 2290, 1012, 4830, 6146, 1037, 17832, 1012, 1007, 1077, 1000, 8040, 28433, 4487, 11703, 13465, 2080, 8902, 24209, 9453, 9033, 17079, 24411, 3401, 2474, 9666, 10440, 8611, 2316, 3771, 2050, 8611, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 2591, 2063, 28059, 1041, 8611, 2316, 3771, 2050, 4487, 4337, 7292, 13663, 24121, 2005, 4371, 2849, 3686, 1012, 1000, 1090, 1006, 12064, 2063, 3972, 6819, 9530, 5332, 29480, 14866, 7163, 3367, 3089, 8611, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 2591, 2063, 28059, 12418, 1005, 2340, 8991, 26416, 2080, 3646, 1033, 9047, 16558, 5555, 3775, 2272, 1024, 2019, 10698, 5302, 1010, 12064, 2072, 3972, 9530, 5332, 29480, 14866, 7163, 3367, 3089, 8611, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 2591, 2063, 28059, 2275, 18532, 13578, 3826, 1011, 2258, 2063, 3386, 1010, 7905, 12848, 3695, 4487, 28093, 2080, 1010, 12836, 1006, 2526, 1007, 1011, 5285, 1012, 1045, 1010, 6643, 2290, 1012, 4830, 20802, 1037, 27054, 1012, 1007, 1077, 2474, 2316, 3771, 2050, 8611, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 2591, 2063, 28059, 1041, 4289, 2050, 4830, 4895, 2852, 29098, 2080, 4487, 2433, 2050, 2128, 5946, 16656, 8017, 2063, 6970, 4143, 3406, 1999, 24326, 4487, 16184, 1010, 4487, 12170, 2319, 3597, 1041, 4487, 5811, 2080, 9530, 6335, 16184, 2035, 1005, 2004, 2696, 2061, 10867, 12162, 6790, 17488, 6904, 11020, 3695, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 3630, 1012, 6335, 2852, 29098, 2080, 16475, 2063, 9686, 8043, 2063, 10766, 2349, 28774, 5831, 8611, 10514, 2050, 11192, 5369, 20715, 3968, 1045, 29461, 3609, 2072, 3158, 3630, 4487, 3367, 3089, 8569, 25090, 20970, 1005, 2030, 10672, 2019, 5831, 3207, 9284, 3968, 1999, 2112, 2072, 1057, 19696, 3669, 1012, 1090, 1006, 2396, 11261, 4135, 1050, 29662, 1015, 3972, 11703, 13465, 2080, 4190, 2483, 20051, 20984, 3972, 26363, 2063, 8611, 16360, 12083, 16558, 5555, 2591, 2063, 28059, 1041, 6178, 2080], "tgt": false, "convo_id": 4122324, "comment_id": 4}
